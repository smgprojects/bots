# Introduction to Twitterbots

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/pIMlKqgdZgvo4" width="120" height="120" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe> In this workshop, we'll start by making simple twitter bots using the [Tracery.io](http://tracery.io) generative grammar, and hosting them at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com)

We'll then make them more complicated, by allowing them to answer back to mentions.

We might make them more complicated again by plumbing in another service, [Zach Whalen's Google Sheets](http://www.zachwhalen.net/posts/how-to-make-a-twitter-bot-with-google-spreadsheets-version-04/) powered bots.

And then, we might explore some of [Stefan's bot templates](https://stefan.glitch.me/) powered by Glitch.com, and why you might want to give those a try.

# Resources

+ **Instructions** I turned my notes prepping for this workshop into a tutorial for the programming historian - [follow along here](https://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/intro-to-twitterbots) (if using Chrome and the page doesn't look very appealing, see if Chrome is 'blocking unsafe scripts' in the right hand side of your address bar. Unblock.)

+ **Hypothesis** You don't have to use this, but it's a very useful Chrome plugin that allows you to annotate web text, and to share those annotations. If you [installed it](https://hypothes.is/), and then used it to mark up my tutorial as you go through it, I would be most grateful. Alternatively, if you'd rather not install another plugin, you can read my [instructions for bot making](https://via.hypothes.is/https://programminghistorian.github.io/ph-submissions/lessons/intro-to-twitterbots) with the annotation layer already pre-loaded. It still requires a login/account to use.

+ **list tool** [delim.co](http://delim.co/#) will take a list and turn it into comma delimited text

+ **tracery editor(s)** We'll begin with [this editor](http://tracery.io/editor/) but there are others out there, eg [this one](http://brightspiral.com/tracery/) and [this one](https://beaugunderson.com/tracery-writer/#) 

+ Kate Compton's **[original interactive Tracery tutorial](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html)**

+ Allison Parish's **[Tracery tutorial](http://air.decontextualize.com/tracery/)**

+ See also all of the resources at [Botwiki](https://botwiki.org/) 

The Tracery source code is [here](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery) and you can use it to generate everything from [games](http://squinky.me/2015/01/19/new-game-interruption-junction/) to [automatically generated novels](http://www.brightspiral.com/) if you know a bit about how to build websites etc. We'll talk about this.
